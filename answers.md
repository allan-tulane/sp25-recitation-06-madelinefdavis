- **2)** $W(n)= W(n-1)+W(n-2)+O(1) = O(2^n)$

- **3)** $S(n)=S(n-1)+O(1)=O(n)$

- **4)** each fibonacci number is computed multiple times due to redunant recursive calls. the lower fibonacci are recalulated many times. this makes this algorithm very inefficient.

- **6)** every fibonacci number is called exactly once. this leads to both a work and span with $O(n)$ complexity

- **8)** the max reading for any $F_i$ is 2. this leads to both a work and span with $O(n)$ complexity
